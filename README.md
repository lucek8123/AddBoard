# AddBoard

I made this SwiftUI package for the best work with [ChartView](https://github.com/AppPear/ChartView). 

## Instalation 
### Using Swift package manager

In your project go to File -> Add Packages -> Paste 'https://github.com/lucek8123/AddBoard' in the search bar -> Select up to next minor version -> Copy Dependency.  

## Usage
_more to come_
